# AWS-Chatbot
A fun, simple chatbot created with Amazon Lex to pair with my website and help familiarize me with AWS.

The creation of the bot itself was all done in the AWS console using Amazon Lex, so this repository just contains the files for implementing a Lambda function I used to give the bot access to a weather API. This code can be found in the handler.js file.
